								<!-- <b>Education:</b> --> I am currently a senior at Fordham University, where I have maintained a GPA of 3.7 studying Mathematics and Computer Science. Due to my background in these subjects, it is no surprise that I fell in love with Data Science upon my first exposure to it. My career goal is to utilize my knowledge of mathematics and programming through data science and apply it to the field of astronomy. Currently, I am applying for Data Science Master’s Programs. In the future, I am also interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in either data science or astronomy.

								<b>Automatic Evaluation of Letters of Recommendation in
STEM Master’s Programs</b> >br> For this research, we have created predictive models with natural language processing and machine learning methods to assess gender and racial bias in graduate school letters of recommendation.<br> I have been contributing to this research paper since June 2022. When it is published in the coming month, I will link it here!
