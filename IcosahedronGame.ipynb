        "Look up what’s an icosahedron: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosahedron It has 20 sides (each of which is an equilateral triangle). Suppose you have an icosahedraldie with the numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . , 20 printed on its sides. If you roll such a die then it will rest on a unique triangle that is facing down, and that triangle has a unique triangle which is the opposite face–the one facing up, the number on that triangle facing up is taken for the number showing up for that roll. Two players play a game like this: \n",
        "- (1) Player A rolls the die 10 times, and computes the sum of all the 10 numbers that show up.\n",
        "- (2) Player B rolls the die 10 times, and computes the sum of all the 10 numbers that show up. \n",
        "\n",
        "Whichever player gets the higher sum is the winner. In case of a tie (the sums are equal),then they play again. Write a Python code to simulate this game."
