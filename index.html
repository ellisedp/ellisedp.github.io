								<p>Hello, my name is Ellise Parnoff! I am a Master of Science in Data Science student at Columbia University’s Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science. Earlier this year, I graduated from Fordham University, where I maintained a GPA of 3.7, studying Mathematics and Computer Science. </p>

<p>My career goal is to use data science for good. One way I seek to do this is by utilizing my knowledge of mathematics and programming through data science to improve social justice issues. I gained experience with this last summer when I had the opportunity to assess gender and racial bias in graduate school letters of recommendation using machine learning and natural language processing. </p> 

<p>One of my biggest strengths is my ability to communicate my technical knowledge. Through my time working at the National Museum of Mathematics, I gained thorough experience communicating multiple advanced math concepts to a wide range of museum-goers. </p>

<p>Above all, I am a highly passionate hard worker who brings 110% to every task. I am currently looking for an internship for summer 2024. I am eager to put my passion for STEM to work. </p>
<p>My skills include, but are not limited to: C++, Github, Google Colab, Google G Suite, Jupyter Notebooks, Linux, Machine Learning, Matlab, Microsoft Office Suite, Python, R, Written and Verbal Communication.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact me at any time with any inquiries or requests! I'd be happy to chat!</p>

									<li>For this project, I worked to find new instances of special prime numbers named Ramanujan Congruence Primes.
									To do this, I designed Python programs to compute multiple advanced mathematical formulas. Through our research,
									we have proven that it is possible to find additional Ramanujan Congruence Primes.</li></p>
